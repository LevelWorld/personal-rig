Install all packages that I like. I'm new to linux so maybe this isn't even a good idea. But because I'm new I will be swapping from one OS to another realitively frequently and find it a bit of a pain trying to track down all the packages that I like. I predominatirly use Desbian based OS and so please don't depend on me quite yet for arch based os which is next on my list.
